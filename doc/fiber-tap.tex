\begin{abstract}
	\noindent Network security is a very important concept in today's information society.
	With the heavy reliance on data communications, comes also a responsibility for its security.
	While fiber cables are an improvement over traditional copper with respect to tapping,
	it is still very possible to tap these cables as we will show in this paper.
	We will give a proof of concept of tapping fiber communications ``on the cheap'',
	using less than \euro{}$20$ in hardware materials.
	As such we recommend that confidential data communication needs to be encrypted,
	even when using fiber optic cables.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
	Terabytes of data are being exchanged over fiber optic cables every day and user rely on their security.
	As can be shown with the recent controversy surrounding the tapping of Google and Yahoo network infrastructure~\cite{googleyahootap},
	the pure physical layer of communications is still assumed to be secure.

	While it is better known that copper taps are easy to install, fiber optic communications are harder to tap.
	In this paper we will investigate the possible ways an intruder may use to tap fiber optic links.
	We we also look into bringing these methods into practice, by supplying a proof of concept implementation.
