\begin{abstract}
	\noindent Network security is a very important concept in today's information society.
	With heavy reliance on data communications comes also a responsibility for its security.
	While fiber cables are an improvement over traditional copper with respect to tapping,
	it is still very possible to tap these cables as we will show in this paper.
	We will give a proof of concept of tapping fiber communications ``on the cheap'',
	using less than \euro{}$20$ in hardware materials.
	As such we recommend that confidential data communication needs to be encrypted,
	even when using fiber optic cables.

\section{Introduction}
	%Subject introduction
	Terabytes of data are being exchanged over fiber optic cables every day and users rely on their security.
	As can be shown with the recent controversy surrounding the tapping of Google and Yahoo network infrastructure~\cite{googleyahootap},
	the pure physical layer of communications is still assumed to be secure.

	Unfortunately, this layer is less secure then people assume it to be.
	There are a number of known methods of extracting information of a fiber link, while avoiding detection.
	These methods will be discussed in the following sections.
	The National Security Agency launched Operation Ivy Bells,
	deploying submarines and divers to install waterproof recording pods on the lines\footnote{As disclosed in an interview with Edward Snowden}.
	\cite{fibertap} shows occurrences of where this happened.

	\subsection{Fiber Bending}
		In order to keep the path loss to a bear minimum, fiber cables are armed with several layers of protection starting with several metal cables and finalizing with a coating. Therefore, it is mandatory to strip the cable down to the fiber before subjecting the cable to any kind of bending process. 

		Fiber Optic bending utilizes the principle of light propagation through an optical fiber.
		To achieve this propagation, the angle of incidence on the core of the fiber,
		should be greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection.
		In the case that the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle, the light will radiate through the cladding,
		allowing eavesdroppers to do their job.
		Hence, bending the cable as displayed in \cref{fig:bending} will allow the light to escape through the cladding.
		The best location to place a receiver in order to ``eavesdrop'' on the transmitted data would be at about 45 degree from the normal,
		really depending on the amount the cable is bent.

	\subsection{Underwater Fiber Tapping}
		In the case that it is desired to use the tapper under water, it is required that the receiver isn't short circuited by the water.
		A substance should be applied to the conducting wires of the transistor to make it reliable under water.
		Additionally, the hardware consisting of the Arduinos and he battery pack should not come into contact with water,
		since that would ruin the entire setup. 

		Several options are available to make the setup water proof, of which the best is designing a water proof case, allowing the power supply,
		the Arduino/microcontroller to remain in a water proof container.
		It should be kept in mind that the anode and cathode belonging to the photo-transistor should not be shortcut by water.

		%Research question and contributions
		While it is better known that copper taps are easy to install, fiber optic communications are harder to tap.
		In this paper we will investigate the possible ways an intruder may use to tap fiber optic links.
		We we also look into bringing these methods into practice, by supplying a proof of concept implementation.

\section{Proof of Concept}
	For the proof of concept we discern three parties, the sender, receiver and tapper.
	The sender and receiver are legitimate communication parties,
	while the tapper tries to gain access to the communications between them.
	For the proof of concept we used Arduino boards for simple prototyping and some other hardware
	that we will discuss in later sections.
	First we set up a fiber optic communication link between sender and receiver,
	after which we installed the tapper.

	\subsection{Fiber Communication}
		At first we tried to set up a communication using two Arduinos, an LED with a wavelength of about \SI{650}{\nano\meter},
		a fiber cable, a lens and a photoresistor.
		We immediately noticed that simply shining the LED into the cable would not work,
		because not enough light enters the cable using this method.
		When using a lens to focus the light on the cable entrance,
		the results were better but still not satisfactory.
		Only after consulting with the Optics department did we give up on using this method
		and ordered a fiber communication kit.

		The kit included a transmitter at \SI{660}{\nano\meter}, receiver, a fiber cable with connectors and some other materials we did not use.
		The adjoining data sheet describes a circuit for a simple \SI{40}{\kilo Bd} communication link,
		which we used for building a basic communication link~\cite[p.15]{avagokit},
		see \cref{fig:transmitter}.
		Initially we planned to have an input resistance of \SI{500}{\ohm} instead of \SI{100}{\ohm},
		but we noticed that the light source has a higher intensity with lower input resistance.
		With more input power it easier to tap the cable, so we opted for a lower resistance.
		The output receiver was built exactly as specified in the data sheet.

		During this process we also investigated methods for data transfer and concluded that Manchester coding was simple but effective.
		At first we started to implement this ourselves, but encountered issues regarding timing and synchronization.
		Luckily we found a library that provides Manchester coding for Arduino~\cite{manchestercoding}.
		Using the material we have so far we coded a transmitter and receiver, which have been appended in~\cref{lst:transmitterCode,lst:receiverCode}.
		In the next section we will discuss the modifications in the tapper code.

	\subsection{Fiber Tap}
		The first step of installing a fiber is removing the isolation.
		The biggest problem in this step is that the cable is very vulnerable and could break.
		We used a knife for the plastic outer layer and sandpaper for the vulnerable inner layer.
		Then by bending the cable a part of the light leaks out,
		because for a portion of the light in the cable the angle of incidence is too small.

		Secondly, we attached a photo sensor to the cable.
		At first we tried using a photo resistor whose operation is very simple,
		its resistance decreases with increasing light intensity.
		This works well for low frequency signals (up to \SI{5}{\hertz}),
		but is insufficient for but the lowest speed data transfers.
		We then switched to a photo transistor with a switching speed of at most \SI{15}{\micro\second}~\cite{phototransistor}.
		This allows a frequency of up to \SI{67}{\kilo\hertz} which is sufficient for our purposes.
		We measured the resistance of the attached transistor when the light was ON and OFF
		at \SI{300}{\kilo\ohm} and over \SI{1}{\mega\ohm} respectively.
		Using this information we built a simple pull-up circuit using a little trial-and-error,
		we came to a final pull-up resistor of \SI{100}{\kilo\ohm}\todo{Check}.
		When reading the ADC input to the Arduino resulted in values of $3 \pm 2$ for ON and between $95 \pm 7$ for OFF,
		which is a respectable enough signal-to-noise ratio.

		Now to interpret the sent Manchester data on the fiber tap we needed to threshold the measurements
		at about $50$ to digitalize the data.
		The given library does not support analog inputs, so we modified the library to use
		a threshold and an analog input for measuring the input signal.
		The resulting library and our code can be online found at~\cite{analogmanchestercoding}.

		For better results and sturdiness we have also constructed a simple container,
		which keeps the cable bended and the photo sensor isolated from external light sources.
		We also found out that printing the results does not take an insignificant amount of time,
		resulting in missed bytes on the tap which is why we buffered the data.
		Using the above components we are successfully able to tap increasing numbers of up to
		$128$ in a row at \SI{300}{Bd}, at which point the Arduino memory limit is reached.

\section{Conclusion}
	In this paper is shown that fiber optic communications are easy to tap, even with cheap hardware.
	We have used less than \euro{}$20$ to assemble a tapper consisting of an Arduino,
	a photo-transistor and a casing.
	Most of the work of this project was actually in setting up a fiber optic communication link,
	so that it may be tapped.
	We reused our receiver code for the tapper, but with a few modifications allowing for an analog input.
	Future work includes looking into detectability of taps, high speed communications
	and underwater operations.
