abstract={Optical fiber communication is not as secure as generally perceived. There are a number of known methods of extracting or injecting information into a fiber link, while avoiding detection. Few incidents have been reported as a successfully tapped fiber is difficult to detect. In this paper we highlight a number of known fiber tapping methods. We report simulation of optical characteristics of a fiber being tapped by `bend' method and proof of concept with physical experiment. We also presented visualized scenarios in which a resourceful eavesdropper can compromise security of a fiber link with existing technologies. Some measures to prevent fiber tapping or to nullify the significance of information tapped from fiber were also discussed.},
